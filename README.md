## :sparkles: Abstract
![model](model.png)

When the solar wind passes over the Earth, it will cause geomagnetic storms, aÔ¨Äect short-wave communications, and threaten the
safety of pipelines such as electricity and oil. Accurate prediction of the solar wind speed will allow people to make adequate
preparations to avoid wasting resources and aÔ¨Äecting people‚Äôs life. Most existing methods only use single-modality data as
input and do not consider the information complementarity between diÔ¨Äerent modalities. This paper proposes a multimodality
prediction (MMP) method that jointly learns vision and sequence information in a uniÔ¨Åed end-to-end framework for solar
wind speed prediction. MMP includes three modules: Vmodule, Tmodule, and Fusion module. Vmodule, which uses
pretrained GoogLeNet, is proposed to learn visual representations from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images. Tmodule
combining one-dimensional CNN with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) is applied for learning sequence
representation from multivariate time series. Finally, a multimodality fusion method is applied to improve the overall
performance. We adopt the EUV images observed by the solar dynamics observatory (SDO) satellite and the OMNIWEB
dataset measured at Lagrangian point 1 (L1) to experiment. Comparative experiments have shown that the proposed MMP
achieves best performance in many metrics. The ablation experiments also verify the validity of each module and the
rationality of the hyperparameter setting.
